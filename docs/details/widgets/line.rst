Overview
********

The Line Widget is capable of drawing straight lines between a set of
points.

Parts and Styles
****************

-  :cpp:enumerator:`LV_PART_MAIN` uses the :ref:`typical background <typical bg props>`
   and line style properties.

.. _lv_line_usage:

Usage
*****

Set points
----------

A Line's points have to be stored in an :cpp:struct:`lv_point_precise_t` array and passed to
the Widget by the :cpp:expr:`lv_line_set_points(lines, point_array, point_cnt)`
function.

Their coordinates can either be specified as raw pixel coordinates
(e.g. ``{5, 10}``), or as a percentage of the Line's bounding box using
:cpp:expr:`lv_pct(x)`. In the latter case, the Line's width/height may need to
be set explicitly using :cpp:func:`lv_obj_set_width` and :cpp:func:`lv_obj_set_height`,
as percentage values do not automatically expand the bounding box.

Auto-size
---------

By default, the Line's width and height are set to :c:macro:`LV_SIZE_CONTENT`.
This means it will automatically set its size to fit all the points. If
the size is set explicitly, parts on the Line may not be visible.

Invert y
--------

By default, the *y == 0* point is in the top of the Widget. It might be
counter-intuitive in some cases so the y coordinates can be inverted
with :cpp:expr:`lv_line_set_y_invert(line, true)`. In this case, *y == 0* will
be at the bottom of the Widget. *y invert* is disabled by default.
