Images

Overview
********

An ``<images>`` section can be added to ``globals.xml`` files.

Later, it might also be supported in components and widgets to define local images and keep the global space cleaner.

This ``<images>`` section describes how to map images with names.

Only ``<file>`` is currently supported, and ``<convert>`` is not yet implemented.

Usage
*****

.. code-block:: xml

	<images>
		<file name="avatar" src_path="avatar1.png">
			<convert path="raw/avatar.svg" width="100px" color_format="L8"/>
		</file>

		<data name="logo" src_path="logo1.png" color-format="rgb565" memory="RAM2">
			<convert path="https://foo.com/image.png" width="50%" height="80%"
			color_format="RGB565"/>
		</data>
	</images>

- ``<file>`` means that the image source is used as a file path:
- ``<data>`` means that the image is converted to a C array on export.

In both cases in the exported C code global ``const void * <image_name>`` variables are created and in the
initialization function of the component library (e.g. ``my_lib_init_gen()``) either the path or
the pointer to the converted :cpp:expr:`lv_image_dsc_t` pointers are assigned to that variable.

In :cpp:expr:`lv_image_set_src(image, <image_name>)` is used
instead of the path or :cpp:expr:`lv_image_dsc_t` pointer directly.


For simplicity, in the UI Editor preview, images are always loaded as files.

If the UI is created from XML at runtime and a ``globals.xml`` is parsed, the ``<data>`` tags are skipped
because it is assumed that the user manually creates the mapping. This is because the XML parser cannot
automatically map an image like:

.. code-block:: c

   lv_image_dsc_t my_logo;

to

.. code-block:: xml

   <data name="my_logo"/>

Constants
---------

Constants can be used with images as well.

.. code-block:: xml

	<consts>
		<int name="icon_size" value="32">
			<variant name="size" case="small" value="16"/>
		</int>
	</consts>

	<images>
		<data name="icon_apply" src_path="apply.png">
			<convert path="raw/apply.png" width="#icon_size"/>
		</data>
	</images>
