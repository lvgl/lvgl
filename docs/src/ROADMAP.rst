Roadmap
=======

v9
--

Schedule
~~~~~~~~

- December 4: Feature stop, start updating the docs and testing
- December 18: Release candidate version and call to test
- January 15: Release v9.0

Naming and API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- |check| `lv_style_set_size()` should have separate width and height parameters
- |check| Reconsider image color formats.
- |check| More consistent names:`remove/clear/delete/del`, `offset/ofs`, `add/create/register`, `id/idx/index`, `middle/mid/center`, `img/image`, `txt/text`, `opa/opacity/alpha`, `scr/screen`, `disp, display`, `finished/complete/completed/ready`, `buf/buffer`,  `..._cb`, `angle/rotation`, `zoom/scale`, `has`, `is`, `enable`
- |check| Update canvas API `LINK <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3393>`__
- |check| `LV_STYLE_PROP_INHERIT` -> `LV_STYLE_PROP_FLAG_INHERITABLE`
  `LINK <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/pull/3390#discussion_r885915769>`__
- |check| Replace `disp_drv->direct_mode/full_refresh` with enum.
- |check| Consider flat directory structure. E.g. `extra/widgets` to `widgets`
- |check| Use `uint32_t` and `int32_t` in APIs where possible. Consider hardcoding `int32_t` as `int32_t`.
- |check| To define a new stdlib API use defines `LV_USE_CUSTOM_...` and
  let the user implement `lv_...` functions somewhere (instead of defining the name of the custom functions)
  (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3481#issuecomment-1206434501>`__)
- |check| Gradient with alpha

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- |check| Consider merging `lv_disp_drv_t`, `lv_disp_t`, `lv_disp_draw_buf_t`, `lv_draw_ctx_t` `struct`'s from the new driver API (or only some of them)
- |check| New driver architecture #2720
- |check| `draw_ctx->buffer_convert`?
  (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3379#issuecomment-1147954592>`__)
  Also remove 16 SWAPPED color format?
  (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3379#issuecomment-1140886258>`__)
- |check| Reconsider masks. There should be a generic high level mask API which is independent of the drawing engine.
  `#4059 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/4059>`__
- |check| `get_glyph_bitmap` should return an a8 bitmap that can be blended immediately.
  (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/pull/3390#pullrequestreview-990710921>`__)
- |check| Make LVGL render independent areas in parallel.
  `#4016 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/4016>`__
- |check| Drop `lv_mem_buf_get` as tlsf should be fast enough for normal allocations as well.
  Fragmentation is also lower if processes can completely clean up after themselves.
- |check| More color formats: 24 bit, ARGB1555, ARGB4444 etc
  (see `here <https://forum.lvgl.io/t/keypad-input-device-why-lv-event-long-pressed-only-on-enter/10263>`__)
- |check| Unified caching #3116 #3415
- |check| Variable binding. I.e create properties which can be bound to Widgets and those Widgets are notified on value change. Maybe based on `lv_msg`?
- |uncheck| Add GPU abstraction for display rotation
- |check| Replace the `read_line_cb` of the image decoders with `get_area_cb`
- |check| Limit the image caching size in bytes instead of image count
- |check| lv_draw_buf for unified stride, buffer and cache invalidation management. `4241 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/pull/4241>`__
- |check| Add vector graphics support via ThorVG
- |check| SVG support: integrate an SVG render library `4388 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/4388>`__
- |check| Introduce optional ``float`` support. `4648 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/4648>`__
- |check| Introduce support layer for 3D GPUs (OpenGL, SDL, Vulkan, etc).  `4622 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/4622>`__

Styles
~~~~~~

- |check| non-uniform scale of images: scale width and height differently
- |check| Scroll anim settings should come from styles to allow customization

Widgets
~~~~~~~

- |check| Universal scale widget/support
- |check| `lv_img`: Reconsider image sizing models
  (when the image size is not content): center, top-left, zoom, tile, other?
- |check| `lv_tabview` Replace button matrix with real buttons for more flexibility
  (see `here <https://forum.lvgl.io/t/linear-meter-bar-with-ticks/10986>`__ and #4043)
- |check| Disabled widgets should absorb indev actions without sending events. `#3860 <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3860>`__

Animations
~~~~~~~~~~

- |check| `lv_anim_time_to_speed` should work differently to remove
  `style_anim_speed`. E.g. on large values of anim time store the
  speed. Besides all widgets should use the `style_anim` property.
  `anim` should clamp the time if it's calculated from speed, e.g
  `lv_clamp(200, t, 2000)`. (maybe `a->min_time/max_time`).
- |uncheck| Use dedicated `lv_anim_custom_exec_cb_t`.
  See `here <https://forum.lvgl.io/t/custom-exec-cb-prevents-lv-anim-del-obj-null/10266>`__.

Ideas
-----
- Reconsider how themes should work.
- Better way to reset global variables in `lv_deinit()` #3385
- `lv_array`: replace linked lists with array where possible (arrays are faster and uses less memory)
- Reconsider how to handle UTF-8 characters (allow different encoding as well) and Bidi. Maybe create an abstraction for textshaping.
- Consider direct binary font format support
- Improve groups. `Discussion <https://forum.lvgl.io/t/lv-group-tabindex/2927/3>`__.
  Reconsider focusing logic. Allow having no widget selected (on web it's possible). Keep editing state in `lv_obj_t`
  (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3646>`__). Support slider
  left knob focusing (see `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/3246>`__)
- Speed up font decompression
- Support larger images: add support for large image #1892
- Functional programming support, pure view?
  (see `here <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-revolution-of-pure-views-aed339db7da4/>`__)
- Style components. (see `this comment <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/2790#issuecomment-965100911>`__
- Support dot_begin and dot_middle long modes for labels
- Allow matrix input for image transformation?
- Radial/skew/conic gradient
- Somehow let children inherit the parent's state
- Text on path
