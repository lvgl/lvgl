recommended order of documents to read and things to play with while you are
advancing your knowledge:

   the documentation.  (5 minutes)
2. Check out the `Online Demos`_ to see LVGL in action.  (3 minutes)
3. If not already done, read the :ref:`learn_the_basics` (above).  (15 minutes)
4. Set up an LVGL :ref:`simulator`.  (10 minutes)
5. Have a look at some :ref:`examples` and their code.
6. :ref:`Integration Overview <adding_lvgl_to_your_project>` or check out
   the `ready-to-use Projects`_.
7. Read the :ref:`main_modules` pages to get a better understanding of the library. (2-3 hours)
8. Skim the documentation of :ref:`widgets` to see what is available.
9. If you have questions go to the `Forum`_.
10. Read the :ref:`contributing` guide to see how you can help to improve LVGL. (15 minutes)
