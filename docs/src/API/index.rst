API Placeholder
***************

This document is here merely as a placeholder so it's LACK of presence when
building the docs like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python build.py html skip_api

(which is done in a doc-development/testing environment) does not generate a warning
because this file is not there.  When the API portion of the documents DOES get
built, this file is replaced with one programmatically generated by ``build.py``
making calls on ``api_doc_builder.py`` and ``doxygen_xml.py`` modules.
