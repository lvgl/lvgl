Preview

Overview
********

In ``<component>`` and ``<widget>``, it is possible to define ``<preview>`` tags.
These are **not** exported to code and are **not** loaded from XML.

They are used only by the UI Editor to describe the context of the component.
For example, you might want to:
- Change the background of the Editor's preview to dark.
- Center the component.
- Set margins.
- Change the size of the preview.

Usage
*****

You can think of a ``<preview>`` tag as an ``lv_obj`` where the following properties can be used:

- ``width``, ``height``
- Any local style properties, for example, ``style_bg_color="0x333"``
- ``flex`` and ``flex_flow``

It is also possible to define multiple previews, and in the UI Editor, you can select one of them.

Example
*******

.. code-block:: xml

  <component>
    <previews>
      <preview name="small_dark" width="content" height="100" style_bg_color="0x333" style_pad_all="32"/>
      <preview name="centered" width="200" height="100" flex="row center"/>
      <preview name="large_light" width="1980" height="1080" style_bg_color="0xeeeeee"/>
    </previews>

    <view>
       ...
    </view>

  </component>
