Constants
=========

Constants live within a ``<consts>`` XML tag as described in the `XML Constants`_ page
of the user docs.

In the :ref:`editor pane`, once you have created your ``<consts>`` tag in the scope
you want it (i.e. ``globals.xml`` or local within a Component or Widget), type ``<``
and use auto-completion editor to select the kind of constant you want to create.
Thereafter, this value can be referred to by name using the name it is given in its
``name="..."`` attribute.  Constants can be used for initial values, coordinates,
dimensions, colors, strings for labels, etc..
