What is |lvglpro|?
******************

|lvglpro| is the visual UI editor for LVGL-based firmware projects in which
you can build UIs in XML, preview them in real time in a pixel-perfect preview,
effectively making UI development much faster than writing C code.

Its output is in the form of XML files that you create (with the help of
|lvglpro|'s smart editor) and/or generated C code, either or both of which can be
reused in any number of LVGL projects.
