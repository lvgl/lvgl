Creating UI Elements
====================

Creating a firmware UI using |lvglpro| is most frequently done by creating
a combination of Components and one or more Screens.  Less frequently, new custom
(derived) Widgets can also be created.  All of these are covered below.

Interestingly, in addition to the text that follows, due to the intelligent nature of
the Editor's auto-completion mechanism, actual hands-on time with the editor can teach
you a great deal as well.

.. note::

    At this stage of learning, it is important to have at least a:

    - general understanding of XML and its syntax, and
    - an understanding of LVGL's `XML Module`_.
