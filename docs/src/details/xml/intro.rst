Introduction
============

LVGL Pro is a complete toolkit to build, test, share, and ship embedded UIs
efficiently.

It consists of 4 main tools:

- **An XML Editor** with powerful autocomplete features to describe UI components,
  screens, tests, animations, data bindings, and many more. A pixel-perfect preview
  shows the UI as you type the XMLs. The Editor is also capable of exporting C code and
  even recompiling its preview to run custom C code. On these pages you can learn more
  about :ref:`XML <xml_overview>` and the :ref:`Editor <editor_overview>`.

- **Online Share** is an online version of the Editor which can load the XML files from
  a GitHub repository to easily share the developed UIs without setting up any
  development environments. Learn more :ref:`here <editor_online_share>`.

- **CLI** (command-line interface) is a tool capable of validating the XML files and
  generating C code from them, or running the UI tests in CI/CD environments. Learn more
  :ref:`here <editor_cli>`.

- **Figma Plugin** that allows you to extract the style properties from Figma elements
  and also synchronize them in the Editor or with the CLI. Learn more :ref:`here
  <editor_figma>`.

These tools together allow developers to build UIs effectively, test them in a simple
and reliable way, and collaborate with the rest of the team and customers.

This section of the documentation teaches all the details of each tool.
