GDB Plug-In

Debugging LVGL with GDB
-----------------------

To facilitate debugging LVGL with GDB, a GDB plugin is provided. This plugin
can be found in the ``lvgl/scripts/gdb`` directory. The GDB plugin can be used
with any target where GDB is available. For example, you can use it to debug a
device connected to a PC via JLink, which provides a GDB server. Additionally,
if your device crashes and you have a core dump, you can use GDB to analyze the
core dump. To load the LVGL GDB plugin within GDB's command line, type the
following command:

``source lvgl/scripts/gdb/gdbinit.py``


Example of usage:

.. code:: bash

    (gdb) source lvgl/scripts/gdb/gdbinit.py

    (gdb) dump obj -L 2
    obj@0x60700000dd10 (0,0,799,599)
    tabview@0x608000204ca0 (0,0,799,599)
        obj@0x607000025da0 (0,0,799,69)
        obj@0x607000025e80 (0,70,799,599)
        obj@0x60700002bd70 (743,543,791,591)
        btn@0x60700002c7f0 (747,547,787,587)
    keyboard@0x60d0000f7040 (0,300,799,599)
    dropdown-list@0x608000205420 (0,0,129,129)
        label@0x60d0000f7ba0 (22,22,56,39)
    (gdb)

The plugin provides the following commands.

- ``dump obj``: Dump the object tree.
- ``info style``: Show the object's style.


Dump obj tree
-------------

``dump obj``: Dump the object tree.

``dump obj -L 2``: Dump the object tree with a depth of 2.

``dump obj -a 0x60700000dd10``: Dump the object tree starting from the specified address.


Show obj's style
----------------

This command can dump the object's local style, since style value is a union, it's displayed in all possible formats.

``info style address_of_obj``: Show the object's style.


Example:

.. code:: bash

    (gdb) info style 0x60700000dd10
      32 = {num = 90, ptr = 0x5a, color = {blue = 90 'Z', green = 0 '\000', red = 0 '\000'}}
      158 = {num = 32767, ptr = 0x7fff, color = {blue = 255 '\377', green = 127 '\177', red = 0 '\000'}}
    (gdb) p lv_global->disp_default->act_scr
    $4 = (lv_obj_t *) 0x60700000dd10
    (gdb) info style $4
      32 = {num = 90, ptr = 0x5a, color = {blue = 90 'Z', green = 0 '\000', red = 0 '\000'}}
      158 = {num = 32767, ptr = 0x7fff, color = {blue = 255 '\377', green = 127 '\177', red = 0 '\000'}}
    (gdb)

Connect to Debugger
-------------------

This command provides the ability to connect and debug GDB Python Script using IDE.

Connect to ``PyCharm`` / ``VSCode`` / ``Eclipse(not support yet)``

``debugger -t pycharm``

``debugger -t vscode``

``debugger -t eclipse``

How to use it specifically, search ``pydevd_pycharm`` / ``debugpy`` for details.
