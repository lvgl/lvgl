===========
RZ/G Family
===========

Supported boards in the RZ/G Family:

- **RZ/G2L-EVKIT**
- **RZ/G2UL-EVKIT**

Run the Project
***************

- The RZ/G boards are MPUs with support for running Linux. Projects are built for them using a cross-compiler
  CLI toolchain SDK in a Linux PC environment (WSL, Docker, etc. can be used on Windows).
- The G2L has a Wayland desktop and the project appears as a Wayland window. The G2UL does not have
  a desktop so the project is fullscreen and uses the ``fbdev`` driver.
- The SDK currently uses LVGL v8.3 so this project uses this version to mirror the SDK version,
  even though LVGL is statically linked. You may try using newer versions of LVGL.
- Clone the ready-to-use repository for your selected board:

    .. code-block:: shell

        git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_rz-g2l-evkit --recurse-submodules


  Downloading the `.zip` from GitHub doesn't work as it doesn't download the submodules.
- Follow the instructions in the project README.md to obtain the SD Card image and toolchain installer,
  build, and upload the project to the board.
- Stop any automatically started demos (on G2UL run ``systemctl stop demo-launcher`` in the terminal).
- Run the project

    .. code-block:: shell

        ./lvgl_demo_benchmark


Modify the project
******************


Open a demo
-----------

The entry point is contained in ``src/main.c``.

You can disable the LVGL demos (``lv_demo_benchmark()``) (or just comment them out)
and call some ``lv_example_...()`` functions, or add your custom code.


Configuration
-------------

Edit ``lv_conf.h`` and ``lv_drv_conf.h`` to configure LVGL. The board image
contains LVGL and lv_drivers as dynamically linkable libraries. This project builds LVGL statically
for customizability and to port the LVGL v9 benchmark LVGL v8.3.


Support
*******

In case of any problems or questions open an issue in the corresponding repository.
