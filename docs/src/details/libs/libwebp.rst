WebP Decoder
=================

**libwebp** is an LVGL interface to the WebP image format --- a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP offers:

- Smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG
- Lossy compression with transparency
- Lossless compression
- Animation support

.. _libwebp_integration:

Adding libwebp to Your Project
******************************

CMake configuration:

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
    pkg_check_modules(WebP REQUIRED libwebp)
    include_directories(${WebP_INCLUDEDIR})
    target_link_libraries(main ${WebP_LINK_LIBRARIES})

.. _libwebp_usage:

Usage
*****

Set :c:macro:`LV_USE_LIBWEBP` in ``lv_conf.h`` to ``1``.

Memory requirements for WebP images:

- Lossy WebP: width × height × 4 bytes (ARGB8888 format)
- Lossless WebP: width × height × 4 bytes (ARGB8888 format)

For optimal memory usage, combine with LVGL's :ref:`overview_image_caching` feature.
