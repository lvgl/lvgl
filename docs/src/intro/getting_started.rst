LVGL Basics
***********

LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a free and open-source graphics
library providing everything you need to create an embedded GUI with easy-to-use
mobile-phone-like graphical elements, beautiful visual effects, and a low memory
footprint.

How does it do this?

    Overview of LVGL Data Flow

You :ref:`add LVGL to your project <adding_lvgl_to_your_project>`, provide it with
inputs and the method for pixels to flow to the display panel(s), connect the
:ref:`tick_interface` so LVGL can tell what time is it, periodically call
:ref:`timer_handler`, build one or more :ref:`Widget Trees <widget_overview>` for
LVGL to render the interactive UI,  and let LVGL do the rest.

The :ref:`timer_handler` function drives LVGL's timers which, in turn, perform a
number of periodic tasks:

- refresh display(s),
- read input devices,
- fire events based on user input (and other things),
- run any animations, and
- run user-created timers.


.. _applications_job:

Application's Job
-----------------

After initialization, the application's job is merely to create :ref:`Widget Trees
<widget_overview>` when they are needed, manage events those Widgets generate (by way
of user interaction and other things), and delete them when they are no longer
needed.  LVGL takes care of the rest.



.. _basics_major_concepts:

Major Concepts
**************


.. _display-vs-screen:

Display vs Screen
-----------------
Before we get into any details about Widgets, let us first clarify the difference
between two terms that you will hereafter see frequently:

- A **Display** or **Display Panel** is the physical hardware displaying the pixels.
- A :ref:`display` object is an object in RAM that represents a **Display** LVGL will render to.
- A **Screen** is the "root" Widget in the :ref:`Widget Trees <widget_overview>`
  mentioned above, and are "attached to" a particular :ref:`display`.


Default Display
---------------
When the first :ref:`display` object is created, it becomes the Default Display.
Many functions related to Screen Widgets use the default display.
See :ref:`default_display` for more information.


.. _basics_screen_widgets:

Screen Widgets
--------------
In this documentation, the term "Screen Widget" is frequently shortened to just
"Screen".  A "Screen" is simply any :ref:`Widget <widgets>` created without a parent
--- the "root" of each Widget Tree.

See :ref:`screens` for more details.


Active Screen
-------------

The Active Screen is the screen (and its child Widgets) currently being displayed.
See :ref:`active_screen` for more information.


.. _widget_overview:

Widgets
-------
After LVGL is initialized (see :ref:`initializing_lvgl`), to create an interactive
user interface, an application next creates a tree of Widgets that LVGL can render to
the associated display, and with which the user can interact.

Widgets are "intelligent" LVGL graphical elements such as :ref:`Base Widget
<base_widget>` (simple rectangles and :ref:`screens`), Buttons, Labels, Checkboxes,
Switches, Sliders, Charts, etc.  See :ref:`widgets` to see the full list.

To build this Widget Tree, the application first acquires a pointer to a Screen Widget.
You are free to use the default Screen created with the :ref:`display` and/or
create your own.  To create a new Screen Widget, simply create a Widget passing
NULL as the parent argument.  Technically, this can be any type of Widget, but in
most cases it is a :ref:`base_widget`.  (An example of another type of Widget
sometimes used as a Screen is an :ref:`lv_image` Widget to supply an image for the
background.)

The application then adds Widgets to this Screen as children in the tree.  Widgets
are automatically added as children to their parent Widgets at time of creation ---
the Widget's parent is passed as the first argument to the function that creates
the Widget.  After being so added, we say that the parent Widget "contains" the
child Widget.

Any Widget can contain other Widgets.  For example, if you want a Button to have
text, create a Label Widget and add it to the Button as a child.

Each child Widget becomes "part of" its parent Widget.  Because of this relationship:

- when the parent Widget moves, its children move with it;
- when the parent Widget is deleted, its children are deleted with it;
- a child Widget is only visible within its parent's boundaries; any part of a child
  outside its parent's boundaries is clipped (i.e. not rendered).

Screens (and their child Widgets) can be created and deleted at any time *except*
when the Screen is the :ref:`active_screen`.  If you want to delete the current Screen
as you load a new one, call :cpp:func:`lv_screen_load_anim` and pass ``true`` for the
``auto_del`` argument.  If you want to keep the current Screen in RAM when you load a
new Screen, pass ``false`` instead, or call :cpp:func:`lv_screen_load` to load the
new screen.

You are free to keep any number of Screens (and their child Widgets) in
RAM (e.g. for quick re-display again later).  Doing so:

- requires more RAM, but
- can avoid repeatedly creating the Screen and its child Widgets;
- can be handy when a Screen is complex and/or can be made the :ref:`active_screen` frequently.

If multiple Screens are maintained in RAM simultaneously, it is up to you how they
are managed.


.. _basics_creating_widgets:

Creating Widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Widgets are created by calling functions that look like this::

    lv_<type>_create(parent)

The call will return an :cpp:expr:`lv_obj_t *` pointer that can be used later to
reference the Widget to set its attributes.

Example:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_obj_t * slider1 = lv_slider_create(lv_screen_active());


.. _basics_modifying_widgets:

Modifying Widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attributes common to all Widgets are set by functions that look like this::

    lv_obj_set_<attribute_name>(widget, <value>)

Example:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_obj_set_x(slider1, 30);
    lv_obj_set_y(slider1, 10);
    lv_obj_set_size(slider1, 200, 50);

All such functions are covered in :ref:`common_widget_features`.

Along with these attributes, widgets can have type-specific attributes which are
set by functions that look like this::

    lv_<type>_set_<attribute_name>(widget, <value>)

Example:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_slider_set_value(slider1, 70, LV_ANIM_ON);

To see the full API for any Widget, see its documentation under :ref:`widgets`, study
its related header file in the source code, e.g.

- lvgl/src/widgets/slider/lv_slider.h

or view it on GitHub, e.g.

- https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/master/src/widgets/slider/lv_slider.h .


.. _basics_deleting_widgets:

Deleting Widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete any widget and its children::

    lv_obj_delete(lv_obj_t * widget)



.. _basics_events:

Events
------

Events are used to inform the application that something has happened with a Widget.
You can assign one or more callbacks to a Widget which will be called when the Widget
is clicked, released, dragged, being deleted, etc.

A callback is assigned like this:

.. code-block:: c

   lv_obj_add_event_cb(btn, my_btn_event_cb, LV_EVENT_CLICKED, NULL);

   ...

   void my_btn_event_cb(lv_event_t * e)
   {
       printf("Clicked\n");
   }

:cpp:enumerator:`LV_EVENT_ALL` can be used instead of :cpp:enumerator:`LV_EVENT_CLICKED`
to invoke the callback for all events.  (Beware:  there are a LOT of events!  This can
be handy for debugging or learning what events occur for a given Widget, or indeed
if the application needs to process all events for some reason.)

Event callbacks receive the argument :cpp:expr:`lv_event_t * e` containing the
current event code and other event-related information.  The current event code can
be retrieved with:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_event_code_t code = lv_event_get_code(e);

The Widget that triggered the event can be retrieved with:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_obj_t * widget = lv_event_get_target(e);

Learn all about Events in the :ref:`events` section.


.. _basics_parts:

Parts
-----

Widgets are built from one or more *parts*.  For example, a button
has only one part called :cpp:enumerator:`LV_PART_MAIN`. However, a
:ref:`lv_slider` has :cpp:enumerator:`LV_PART_MAIN`, :cpp:enumerator:`LV_PART_INDICATOR`
and :cpp:enumerator:`LV_PART_KNOB`.

By using parts you can apply different :ref:`styles <basics_styles>` to sub-elements
of a widget.

Read the Widget's documentation to learn which parts it uses.


.. _basics_states:

States
------

Widgets can be in a combination of the following states:

- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_DEFAULT`: Normal, released state
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_CHECKED`: Toggled or checked state
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_FOCUSED`: Focused via keypad or encoder or clicked via touchpad/mouse
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_FOCUS_KEY`: Focused via keypad or encoder but not via touchpad/mouse
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_EDITED`: Edit by an encoder
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_HOVERED`: Hovered by mouse
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_PRESSED`: Being pressed
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_SCROLLED`: Being scrolled
- :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_DISABLED`: Disabled

For example, if you press a Widget it will automatically go to the
:cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_FOCUSED` and :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_PRESSED` states.  When you
release it the :cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_PRESSED` state will be removed while the
:cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_FOCUSED` state remains active.

To check if a Widget is in a given state use
:cpp:expr:`lv_obj_has_state(widget, LV_STATE_...)`. It will return ``true`` if the
Widget is currently in that state.

To programmatically add or remove states use:

.. code-block:: c

   lv_obj_add_state(widget, LV_STATE_...);
   lv_obj_remove_state(widget, LV_STATE_...);


.. _basics_styles:

Styles
------

A style instance contains properties such as background color, border
width, font, etc. that describe the appearance of Widgets.

Styles are carried in :cpp:struct:`lv_style_t` objects.  Only their pointer is saved
in the Widgets so they need to be defined as static or global variables.  Before
using a style it needs to be initialized with ``lv_style_init(&style1)``.
After that, properties can be added to configure the style.  For example:

.. code-block:: c

    static lv_style_t style1;
    lv_style_init(&style1);
    lv_style_set_bg_color(&style1, lv_color_hex(0xa03080))
    lv_style_set_border_width(&style1, 2))

See :ref:`style_properties_overview` for more details.

See :ref:`style_properties` to see the full list.

If a property is not set for the current state, the style with
:cpp:enumerator:`LV_STATE_DEFAULT` will be used. A default value is used if the
property is not defined in the default state.

Some properties (particularly the text-related ones) can be inherited. This
means if a property is not set in a Widget it will be searched for in
its parents. For example, you can set the font once in the screen's
style and all text on that screen will inherit it by default.

Local style properties also can be added to Widgets. This creates a
style which resides inside the Widget and is used only by that Widget:

.. code-block:: c

    lv_obj_set_style_bg_color(slider1, lv_color_hex(0x2080bb), LV_PART_INDICATOR | LV_STATE_PRESSED);

See :ref:`styles` for full details.


.. _basics_themes:

Themes
------

Themes are a set of default styles for Widgets. Styles from an active theme are
applied automatically when Widgets are created.

The theme for your application is a compile time configuration setting in
``lv_conf.h``.


.. _basics_micropython:

MicroPython
-----------

LVGL can even be used with :ref:`micropython`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize
    import display_driver
    import lvgl as lv

    # Create a button with a label
    scr = lv.obj()
    btn = lv.button(scr)
    btn.align(lv.ALIGN.CENTER, 0, 0)
    label = lv.label(btn)
    label.set_text('Hello World!')
    lv.screen_load(scr)



.. _basic_examples:

Basic Examples
**************

Below are several basic examples.  They include the application code that produces
the Widget Tree needed to make LVGL render the examples shown.  Each example assumes
a LVGL has undergone normal initialization, meaning that a ``lv_display_t`` object
was created and therefore has an :ref:`active_screen`.

.. include:: ../examples/get_started/index.rst



.. _whats_next:

What's Next?
************

There are several good ways ways to gain deeper knowledge of LVGL.  Here is one
recommended order of documents to read and things to play with while you are
advancing your knowledge:

1. If not already read, start with :ref:`introduction` page of
   the documentation.  (5 minutes)
2. Check out the `Online Demos`_ to see LVGL in action.  (3 minutes)
3. If not already done, read the :ref:`lvgl_basics` (above).  (15 minutes)
4. Set up an LVGL :ref:`simulator`.  (10 minutes)
5. Have a look at some :ref:`examples` and their code.
6. :ref:`Add LVGL to your project <adding_lvgl_to_your_project>` or check out
   the `ready-to-use Projects`_.
