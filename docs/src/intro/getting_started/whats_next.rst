3. If not already done, read the :ref:`learn_the_basics` (above).  (15 minutes)
4. Set up an LVGL :ref:`simulator`.  (10 minutes)
5. Have a look at some :ref:`examples` and their code.
6. :ref:`Add LVGL to your project <adding_lvgl_to_your_project>` or check out
   the `ready-to-use Projects`_.
7. Read the :ref:`main_modules` pages to get a better understanding of the library. (2-3 hours)
