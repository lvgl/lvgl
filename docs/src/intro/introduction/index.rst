LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a free and open-source graphics
library providing everything you need to create an embedded GUI with easy-to-use
graphical elements, beautiful visual effects, and a low memory footprint.

You :ref:`add LVGL to your project <adding_lvgl_to_your_project>`, provide it with
inputs and the method for pixels to flow to the display panel(s), and LVGL does the
heavy lifting in between.
