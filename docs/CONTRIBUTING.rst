Introduction
************

Join LVGL's community and leave your footprint in the library!

There are a lot of ways to contribute to LVGL even if you are new to the
library or even new to programming.

It might be scary to make the first step but you have nothing to be
afraid of. A friendly and helpful community is waiting for you. Get to
know like-minded people and make something great together.

So let's find which contribution option fits you the best and helps you
join the development of LVGL!

Ways to Contribute
******************

- **Spread the Word**: Share your LVGL experience with friends or on social media to boost its visibility.
- **Star LVGL**   Give us a star on `GitHub <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl>`__! It helps a lot to make LVGL more appealing for newcomers.
- **Report a Bug**: Open a `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues>`__ if something is not working.
- **Join Our** `Forum <https://forum.lvgl.io/>`__ : Meet fellow developers and discuss questions.
- **Tell Us Your Ideas**: If you feel something is missing from LVGL, we would love to hear about it in a `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues>`__
- **Develop Features**: Help to design or develop a feature. See below.

Mid- and large-scale issues are discussed in `Feature Planning <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feat-planning.yml>`__ issues.

An issue can be developed when all the questions in the issue template are answered and there are no objection from any core member.

We are using GitHub labels to show the state and attributes of the issues and Pull requests.
If you are looking for contribution opportunities you can `Filter for these labels <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/labels>`__ :

- ``Simple``: Good choice to get started with an LVGL contribution
- ``PR needed``: We investigated the issue but it still needs to be implemented
- ``Review needed``: A Pull request is opened and it needs review/testing


.. _contributing_pull_requests:

Pull Requests
*************

Merging new code into LVGL, documentation, blog, examples, and other
repositories happens via *Pull requests* (PR for short). A PR is a
notification like "Hey, I made some updates to your project. Here are
the changes, you can add them if you want." To do this you need a copy
(called fork) of the original project under your account, make some
changes there, and notify the original repository about your updates.
You can see what it looks like on GitHub for LVGL here:
https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/pulls.

To add your changes you can edit files online on GitHub and send a new
Pull request from there (recommended for small changes) or add the
updates in your favorite editor/IDE and use ``git`` to publish the changes
(recommended for more complex updates).

From GitHub
-----------

1. Navigate to the file you want to edit.
2. Click the Edit button in the top right-hand corner.
3. Add your changes to the file.
4. Add a commit message at the bottom of the page.
5. Click the *Propose changes* button.

From Command Line
-----------------

The instructions describe the main ``lvgl`` repository but it works the
same way for the other repositories.

1. Fork the `lvgl repository <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl>`__. To do this click the
   "Fork" button in the top right corner. It will "copy" the ``lvgl``
   repository to your GitHub account (``https://github.com/<YOUR_NAME>?tab=repositories``)
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Add your changes. You can create a *feature branch* from THE ``master`` branch for the updates: ``git checkout -b <new-feature-branch-name>``
4. Commit and push your changes to the forked ``lvgl`` repository.
5. Create a PR on GitHub from the page of your ``lvgl`` repository (``https://github.com/<YOUR_NAME>/lvgl``) by
   clicking the *"New pull request"* button. Don't forget to select the branch where you added your changes.
6. Set the base branch where you want to merge your update. In the ``lvgl`` repo both fixes
   and new features are directed to the ``master`` branch.
7. Describe what is in the update. Example code is welcome if applicable.
8. If you need to make more changes, just update your forked ``lvgl`` repo with new commits.
   They will automatically appear in the PR.

.. _contributing_commit_message_format:

Commit Message Format
---------------------

The commit messages format is inspired by `Angular Commit
Format <https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit>`__.

The following structure should be used:

.. code-block::

   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   <BLANK LINE>
   <body>
   <BLANK LINE>
   <footer>

Possible ``<type>``\ s:

- ``fix`` bugfix in LVGL source code
- ``feat`` new feature
- ``arch`` architectural changes
- ``perf`` changes that affect performance
- ``example`` anything related to examples (including fixes and new examples)
- ``docs`` anything related to documentation (including fixes, formatting, and new pages)
- ``test`` anything related to tests (new and updated tests or CI actions)
- ``chore`` any minor formatting or style changes that would make the changelog noisy

``<scope>`` is the name of the module, file, or subsystem affected by the
commit. It's usually one word and can be chosen freely. For example
``img``, ``layout``, ``txt``, ``anim``. The scope can be omitted.

``<subject>`` contains a short description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes",
- don't capitalize the first letter,
- no period (``.``) at the end,
- max 90 characters.

``<body>`` optional and can be used to describe details of the
change.

``<footer>`` shall contain

- the words "BREAKING CHANGE" if the changes break the API
- reference to the GitHub issue or Pull Request if applicable.
  (See `Linking a pull rquest to an issue <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue>`__
  for details.)

Some examples:

.. code-block:: text

    fix(image): update size when a new source is set

.. code-block:: text

    fix(bar): fix memory leak

    The animations weren't deleted in the destructor.

    Fixes: #1234

.. code-block:: text

    feat: add span widget

    The span widget allows mixing different font sizes, colors and styles.
    It's similar to HTML <span>

.. code-block:: text

    docs(porting): fix typo



.. _contributing_dco:

Developer Certification of Origin (DCO)
***************************************

Overview
--------

To ensure all licensing criteria are met for every repository of the
LVGL project, we apply a process called DCO (Developer's Certificate of
Origin).

The text of DCO can be read here: https://developercertificate.org/.

By contributing to any repositories of the LVGL project you agree that
your contribution complies with the DCO.

If your contribution fulfills the requirements of the DCO, no further
action is needed. If you are unsure feel free to ask us in a comment,
e.g. in your submitted :ref:`Pull Request <contributing_pull_requests>`.

Accepted licenses and copyright notices
---------------------------------------

To make the DCO easier to digest, here are some practical guides about
specific cases:

Your own work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest case is when the contribution is solely your own work. In
this case you can just send a Pull Request without worrying about any
licensing issues.

Use code from online source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the code you would like to add is based on an article, post or
comment on a website (e.g. StackOverflow) the license and/or rules of
that site should be followed.

For example in case of StackOverflow, a notice like this can be used:

.. code-block::

   /* The original version of this code-snippet was published on StackOverflow.
    * Post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345
    * Author: http://stackoverflow.com/users/12345/username
    * The following parts of the snippet were changed:
    * - Check this or that
    * - Optimize performance here and there
    */
    ... code snippet here ...

Use MIT licensed code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As LVGL is MIT licensed, other MIT licensed code can be integrated
without issues. The MIT license requires a copyright notice be added to
the derived work. Any derivative work based on MIT licensed code must
copy the original work's license file or text.

Use GPL licensed code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GPL license is not compatible with the MIT license. Therefore, LVGL
cannot accept GPL licensed code.
