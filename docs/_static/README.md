This file's sole purpose is to keep the ./docs/_static/ directory there because SOMETHING is assuming it is there in the docs build/deploy scripts.  This directory may go away later when that is better understood.  I (Vic) THINKS that the _static/ directory should have never been used (it's part of the Sphinx input) and that the emscripten content for the examples on the website needs its own directory.
