/**
 * Run all benchmark scenes.
 *
 * On the summary end screen the values shall be interpreted according to the following:
 * - CPU usage:
 *    - If `LV_SYSMON_GET_IDLE` is not modified it's measured based on the time spent in
 *      `lv_timer_handler`.
 *    - If an (RT)OS is used `LV_SYSMON_GET_IDLE` can be changed to a custom function
 *      which returns the idle percentage of idle task.
 *
 * - FPS: LVGL attempted to render this many times in a second. It's limited based on `LV_DEF_REFR_PERIOD`
 *
 * - Render time: LVGL spent this much time with rendering only. It's not aware of task yielding,
 *   but simply the time difference between the start and end of the rendering is measured
 *
 * - Flush time: It's the sum of
 *     - the time spent in the `flush_cb` and
 *     - the time spent with waiting for flush ready.
