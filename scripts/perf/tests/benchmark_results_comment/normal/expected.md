Hi :wave:, thank you for your PR!

We've run benchmarks in an emulated environment. Here are the results:

#### ARM Emulated 32b - lv_conf_perf32b

Disclaimer: These benchmarks were run in an emulated environment using QEMU with instruction counting mode.
The timing values represent relative performance metrics within this specific virtualized setup and should
not be interpreted as absolute real-world performance measurements. Values are deterministic and useful for
comparing different LVGL features and configurations, but may not correlate directly with performance on
physical hardware. The measurements are intended for comparative analysis only.
